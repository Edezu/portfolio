This project is meant for my potential employers to see and recognize my skills as a developer. This will enable me easily talk about myself with confidence while providing a proof of what I am presenting to my potential employers

**Problem Statement and Solution**
Before this project, I personally struggled to express myself as a developer because I had no platform where I could showcase my work and even defend myself better by mentioning about my skills and the work I have accomplished to my potential employers.
The Solution: With this project, potential employers find it easy to guage the skills and experience they are looking for, making it easy for them to decide on whether to hire someone or not.

**Project Goals and Objectives**
**Main goal:** The main goal of the project is to build an online presence in a way of online curriculum vitea that will talk on my behalf when I am seeking opportunities from partners and potential employers

**Technical Stack and Tools**
Technologies Used: The project was simple in it's state as it was developed using HTML and CSS without using any frameworks and libraries.
Tools and Platforms: Git and Git hub were used to track changes and display the pages for viewers in a public domain.

**Features and Functionality**
**Key Features:** The key features of the portfolio project include the landing page that acts as the central place where users are directed to other important pages and resources in the website, as well as welcoming them.
Another key feature is the portforlio that displays the projects that I have successfully accomplished. This featue enables my site's visitors to quickly look through the projects I have accomplished using the skillset that were described in the landing page. This feature will in the the near future capture my curriculum vitea that my partners can be able to view.

**User Flow:**
Users will access the website though the URL that takes them to the landing page. The landing page provides a quick navigation for the users to other pages and resources.
While in the landing page, the user can quickly discover my skill set at the first scroll.
The navigation bar provide links to the landing page, labeled as the home, about page that takes the user to where my profile is situated. Also, we have the portfolio link that takes the user to the portfolio page where they are able to view my work. lastly, there is the contact link that provides the users an option to express their views through texting and submitting their opinion.
In all the pages, a section just above the footer provides quick links to social media pages in a side panel and contact details in the right end where telephone number and email are supplied. The email and telephone numbers are linked to their respective client applications where a user is taken to the applcation to compose a new email, for example. For the case of telephone number, a user is taken to their primary call application if they click on the telephone number supplied with the number supplied, ready for dialing.

**Challenges and Learning**
Technical Challenges: While developing the website, I experienced numerous chaallenges ranging from technical to operational challenges.
Technically, it was difficult to implement some of the ideas in the design that I thought would have been easy to implement. This challenge was overcome by consulting my seniors and reading online resources that provided similar solutions, making it a little simpler for me to crack the idea.
Time limitation was another challenging factor as the project was under strict tmeline where high quality possible was emphasized. I had to plan my limited time as much as possible by time sharing among a number of activities that required my attention, both project related and none-project related.

**Lessons Learned:** 
During the project, I learnt that it is not to accomplish a project without commitment, passion, and ccollaborative efforts.
Also, I learnt that projects are time bound and that within the stipulated project development period, high quality intensive work has to be done rigorously to achieve the intended purpose of the project.

**Future Enhancements**
In the future, I expect to improve the project such that I am able to prepare my CV that can be downloaded in suitable formats such as word document or PDF.
